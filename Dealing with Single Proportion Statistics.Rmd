#It has been observed that some persons who suffer colitis are diagnosed with it again within one year of the first #episode. This is due, in part, to damage from the first episode. In order to examine the percentage of the persons who #suffer colitis a second time, a random sample of 1000 people who suffered colitis was collected. It was observed that #15 of them again suffered colitis within one year. Select a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of those #who suffer a second episode.

#Television viewers often express doubts about the validity of certain commercials. In an attempt to answer their critics, a large advertiser wants to estimate the true proportion of consumers who believe what is shown in commercials. Preliminary studies indicate that about 40% of those surveyed believe what is shown in commercials. What is the minimum number of consumers that should be sampled by the advertiser to be 98% confident that their estimate will fall within 1% of the true population proportion?

#An oil company is interested in estimating the true proportion of female truck drivers based in five southern states. A statistician hired by the oil company must determine the sample size needed in order to make the estimate accurate to within 2% of the true proportion with 99% confidence. What is the minimum number of truck drivers that the statistician should sample in these southern states in order to achieve the desired accuracy?
